# Solar_Buck

The script and Simulation project were made using MATLAB 2023B

Change the folder path to the one you will be using, as an example the one used to generate the data for the presented paper:
folderpath = 'E:\Matlab\DCConverters\Real-Time-Buck\ColabData\';

To generate data execute the file "colab_datagen.m".

Plain text files will start generating automatically containing information in the following columns (separated by semicolons):

Time; Duty Cycle; Inductor Current; RMS Current; Capacitor Voltage; Power; Load;

If needed, the file "read_script" can be executed to load back the information of a text file to MATLAB's workspace.
